                    <h3>Coffee is culture</h3>

                        <p>
                            Going back in time, we’ve seen that coffee is not just a drink. It is actually a lot more. In the past, people gathered in houses to share a cup of coffee and exchange information.

                        <p>
                            In North America and a lot of western European countries, Starbucks and other coffee chains have dominated the market because they are providing to the customers a complete experience around coffee. Coffee and friends, coffee and work, coffee and snacks and coffee to go! The Irish mix coffee with whiskey and they call it “Irish coffee”. In Italy the espresso and espresso machine were born and made it the favorite whole-day beverage of Italians. In Greece, there is the “kafenio”, an old fashioned coffee shop for old gentlemen, where they drink Greek coffee and exchange political ideas or they play cards and a board game called “tavli”. Then also, in some countries, like Colombia or Brazil, the whole economy is based in coffee.

                    <h4>2. Hawaii is the only American state that grows coffee</h4>

                        <p>
                            Good coffee growing conditions require high altitudes, tropical climates, and rich soil. There is only one state, Hawaii, which is able to grow coffee.  It has been producing coffee even before it was a state. (Only recently, though, farms in California started growing coffee bushes!)

                    <h4>3. Coffee was discovered by a goat herder</h4>

                        <p>
                            It was said that coffee was discovered by a goat herder in Ethiopia in the 1500s.  He saw his goats eating coffee cherries. Afterwards, he observed a change in their behavior. They gained a high amount of energy and they didn’t sleep at night.  The herder shared his findings with local monks and then after they made a drink with coffee beans, they realized they could stay up all night and pray. Then, they spread the word to other Ethiopian monks and it reached across the civilized world.
